RMySQL
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstats-db/RMySQL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstats-db/RMySQL)

RMySQL is a database interface and MySQL driver for R. This version complies with the database interface definition as implemented in the package DBI 0.2-2. 

## Installation

The released version from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("RMySQL")
```

The development version from github:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstats-db/RMySQL")
```

## MySQL configuration file

Instead of specifying a username and password in calls to `dbConnect()`, it's better to set up a MySQL configuration file that names the databases that you connect to most commonly. This file should live in `~/.my.cnf` and look like:

```
[database_name]
option1=value1
option2=value2
```

If you want to be able to run the examples, you'll need to set up a database called `rs-dbi`. For a default single user install of MySQL, the following code should work:

```
[rs-dbi]
database=test
username=root
password=
```
