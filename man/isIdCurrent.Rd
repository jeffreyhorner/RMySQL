\title{Check whether a database handle object is valid or not}
\usage{
isIdCurrent(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{any \code{dbObject} (e.g., \code{dbDriver}, \code{dbConnection},
\code{dbResult}).}
}
\value{
a logical scalar.
}
\description{
Support function that verifies that an object holding a reference to a
foreign object is still valid for communicating with the RDBMS
}
\details{
\code{dbObjects} are R/S-Plus remote references to foreign objects. This
introduces differences to the object's semantics such as persistence (e.g.,
connections may be closed unexpectedly), thus this function provides a
minimal verification to ensure that the foreign object being referenced can
be contacted.
